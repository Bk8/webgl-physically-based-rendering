Access this project at https://brandonly101.github.io/webgl-physically-based-rendering

This is a personal project that implements physically-based rendering in WebGL. This is a work-in-progress, and as such, only the following things have been implemented:

* Blinn-phong shading model
* Environment mapping

Included is a small matrix library that I have developed to supplement the project's matrix computations.
